## 🧠 Overview  

**The Liberty City Preservation Project** is a community-driven modification for **GTA V** that focuses on bringing the atmosphere and layout of **Liberty City** into the modern GTA V environment. It’s designed for players who want to explore a familiar city with updated visuals, lighting, and overall presentation on a newer engine.

This project emphasizes exploration and immersion: cruising through recognizable streets, revisiting iconic areas, and experiencing a different tone compared to Los Santos. It can be used for cinematic content creation, roleplay setups, or simply free-roam sessions focused on discovery.

Because it’s a mod, compatibility can depend on your GTA V version and other installed add-ons. Keeping your mod folder organized and avoiding conflicting map mods can help ensure a smoother experience.

## Additional Information  

For best stability, use a clean mod setup and avoid installing multiple large map modifications at the same time. If the archive includes a readme or installation notes, follow those steps first, since mod file placement can differ between builds.

This project is primarily focused on the environment and exploration experience. If you plan to use it for content creation, pairing it with visual enhancements and a stable mod loader setup can noticeably improve results.
